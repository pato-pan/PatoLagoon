This is a repository where I will store every public version of my scripts, programs, tools, and anything else I make that doesn't deserve a dedicated repo.

I can guarantee they work. Pull requests are always untested.

**REMINDER TO SELF: ONLY UPDATE THROUGH PULL REQUESTS.** It's easier to delete things this way

This repo also serves me as a online good backup of what I created. I currently only have offline backups.

**Note to self:** Backup to the cloud, but make it much more limited and much less space consuming than my external backups (because I won't pay for this.)
