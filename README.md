This is a repository where I will store every public version of my scripts, programs, tools, and anything else I make that doesn't deserve a dedicated repo.

I can guarantee they work. Pull requests are always untested.

**REMINDER TO SELF: ONLY UPDATE THROUGH PULL REQUESTS.** It's easier to delete things this way. You can always find the latest version of my scripts there if I haven't updated them here, but they may not work.
